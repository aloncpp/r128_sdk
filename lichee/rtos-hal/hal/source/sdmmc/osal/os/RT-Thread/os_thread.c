/**
 * @brief Create and start a thread
 *
 * This function starts a new thread. The new thread starts execution by
 * invoking entry(). The argument arg is passed as the sole argument of entry().
 *
 * @note After finishing execution, the new thread should call OS_ThreadDelete()
 *       to delete itself. Failing to do this and just returning from entry()
 *       will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * @param[in] thread Pointer to the thread object
 * @param[in] name A descriptive name for the thread. This is mainly used to
 *                 facilitate debugging.
 * @param[in] entry Entry, which is a function pointer, to the thread function
 * @param[in] arg The sole argument passed to entry()
 * @param[in] priority The priority at which the thread will execute
 * @param[in] stackSize The number of bytes the thread stack can hold
 * @retval OS_Status, OS_OK on success
