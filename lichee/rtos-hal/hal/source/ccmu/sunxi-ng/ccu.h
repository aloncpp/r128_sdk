/**
 * struct clk_ops -  Callback operations for hardware clocks; these are to
 * be provided by the clock implementation, and will be called by drivers
 * through the clk_* api.
 *
 * @prepare:    Prepare the clock for enabling. This must not return until
 *      the clock is fully prepared, and it's safe to call clk_enable.
 *      This callback is intended to allow clock implementations to
 *      do any initialisation that may sleep. Called with
 *      prepare_lock held.
 *
 * @unprepare:  Release the clock from its prepared state. This will typically
 *      undo any work done in the @prepare callback. Called with
 *      prepare_lock held.
 *
 * @is_prepared: Queries the hardware to determine if the clock is prepared.
 *      This function is allowed to sleep. Optional, if this op is not
 *      set then the prepare count will be used.
 *
 * @unprepare_unused: Unprepare the clock atomically.  Only called from
 *      clk_disable_unused for prepare clocks with special needs.
 *      Called with prepare mutex held. This function may sleep.
 *
 * @enable: Enable the clock atomically. This must not return until the
 *      clock is generating a valid clock signal, usable by consumer
 *      devices. Called with enable_lock held. This function must not
 *      sleep.
 *
 * @disable:    Disable the clock atomically. Called with enable_lock held.
 *      This function must not sleep.
 *
 * @is_enabled: Queries the hardware to determine if the clock is enabled.
 *      This function must not sleep. Optional, if this op is not
 *      set then the enable count will be used.
 *
 * @disable_unused: Disable the clock atomically.  Only called from
 *      clk_disable_unused for gate clocks with special needs.
 *      Called with enable_lock held.  This function must not
 *      sleep.
 *
 * @save_context: Save the context of the clock in prepration for poweroff.
 *
 * @restore_context: Restore the context of the clock after a restoration
 *      of power.
 *
 * @recalc_rate Recalculate the rate of this clock, by querying hardware. The
 *      parent rate is an input parameter.  It is up to the caller to
 *      ensure that the prepare_mutex is held across this call.
 *      Returns the calculated rate.  Optional, but recommended - if
 *      this op is not set then clock rate will be initialized to 0.
 *
 * @round_rate: Given a target rate as input, returns the closest rate actually
 *      supported by the clock. The parent rate is an input/output
 *      parameter.
 *
 * @determine_rate: Given a target rate as input, returns the closest rate
 *      actually supported by the clock, and optionally the parent clock
 *      that should be used to provide the clock rate.
 *
 * @set_parent: Change the input source of this clock; for clocks with multiple
 *      possible parents specify a new parent by passing in the index
 *      as a u8 corresponding to the parent in either the .parent_names
 *      or .parents arrays.  This function in affect translates an
 *      array index into the value programmed into the hardware.
 *      Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * @get_parent: Queries the hardware to determine the parent of a clock.  The
 *      return value is a u8 which specifies the index corresponding to
 *      the parent clock.  This index can be applied to either the
 *      .parent_names or .parents arrays.  In short, this function
 *      translates the parent value read from hardware into an array
 *      index.  Currently only called when the clock is initialized by
 *      __clk_init.  This callback is mandatory for clocks with
 *      multiple parents.  It is optional (and unnecessary) for clocks
 *      with 0 or 1 parents.
 *
 * @set_rate:   Change the rate of this clock. The requested rate is specified
 *      by the second argument, which should typically be the return
 *      of .round_rate call.  The third argument gives the parent rate
 *      which is likely helpful for most .set_rate implementation.
 *      Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * @set_rate_and_parent: Change the rate and the parent of this clock. The
 *      requested rate is specified by the second argument, which
 *      should typically be the return of .round_rate call.  The
 *      third argument gives the parent rate which is likely helpful
 *      for most .set_rate_and_parent implementation. The fourth
 *      argument gives the parent index. This callback is optional (and
 *      unnecessary) for clocks with 0 or 1 parents as well as
 *      for clocks that can tolerate switching the rate and the parent
 *      separately via calls to .set_parent and .set_rate.
 *      Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * @recalc_accuracy: Recalculate the accuracy of this clock. The clock accuracy
 *      is expressed in ppb (parts per billion). The parent accuracy is
 *      an input parameter.
 *      Returns the calculated accuracy.  Optional - if this op is not
 *      set then clock accuracy will be initialized to parent accuracy
 *      or 0 (perfect clock) if clock has no parent.
 *
 * @get_phase:  Queries the hardware to get the current phase of a clock.
 *      Returned values are 0-359 degrees on success, negative
 *      error codes on failure.
 *
 * @set_phase:  Shift the phase this clock signal in degrees specified
 *      by the second argument. Valid values for degrees are
 *      0-359. Return 0 on success, otherwise -EERROR.
 *
 * @get_duty_cycle: Queries the hardware to get the current duty cycle ratio
 *              of a clock. Returned values denominator cannot be 0 and must be
 *              superior or equal to the numerator.
 *
 * @set_duty_cycle: Apply the duty cycle ratio to this clock signal specified by
 *              the numerator (2nd argurment) and denominator (3rd  argument).
 *              Argument must be a valid ratio (denominator > 0
 *              and >= numerator) Return 0 on success, otherwise -EERROR.
 *
 * @init:   Perform platform-specific initialization magic.
 *      This is not not used by any of the basic clock types.
 *      Please consider other ways of solving initialization problems
 *      before using this callback, as its use is discouraged.
 *
 * @debug_init: Set up type-specific debugfs entries for this clock.  This
 *      is called once, after the debugfs directory entry for this
 *      clock has been created.  The dentry pointer representing that
 *      directory is provided as an argument.  Called with
 *      prepare_lock held.  Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * @pre_rate_change: Optional callback for a clock to fulfill its rate
 *      change requirements before any rate change has occurred in
 *      its clock tree. Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * @post_rate_change: Optional callback for a clock to clean up any
 *      requirements that were needed while the clock and its tree
 *      was changing states. Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
 *
 * The clk_enable/clk_disable and clk_prepare/clk_unprepare pairs allow
 * implementations to split any work between atomic (enable) and sleepable
 * (prepare) contexts.  If enabling a clock requires code that might sleep,
 * this must be done in clk_prepare.  Clock enable code that will never be
 * called in a sleepable context may be implemented in clk_enable.
 *
 * Typically, drivers will call clk_prepare when a clock may be needed later
 * (eg. when a device is opened), and clk_enable when the clock is actually
 * required (eg. from an interrupt). Note that clk_prepare MUST have been
 * called before clk_enable.

 * CLK_MUX_INDEX_ONE - register index starts at 1, not 0
 * CLK_MUX_INDEX_BIT - register index is a single bit (power of two)
 * CLK_MUX_HIWORD_MASK - The mux settings are only in lower 16-bit of this
 *  register, and mask of mux bits are in higher 16-bit of this register.
 *  While setting the mux bits, higher 16-bit should also be updated to
 *  indicate changing mux bits.
 * CLK_MUX_READ_ONLY - The mux registers can't be written, only read in the
 *  .get_parent clk_op.
 * CLK_MUX_ROUND_CLOSEST - Use the parent rate that is closest to the desired
 *  frequency.
 * CLK_MUX_BIG_ENDIAN - By default little endian register accesses are used for
 *  the mux register.  Setting this flag makes the register accesses big
 *  endian.
